This is the infrastructure (and when finished the score) to an algorithmically composed piece of music. I use Lisp and the Common Lisp Music, Slippery Chicken and Layers Package. Additionally to this a sample library is needed and the paths to the samples must be changed in soundfiles.lsp

This is free to use (credit would be much appreciated) and without any warranty.
